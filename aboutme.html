<center> <font size = "3"> Thrift shops have been my haven for years… which maybe hasn’t been so great for my bank account… but I’ve learned so much about myself and the world through them!
So many people ask me where I get my clothes from and for a long time, I would be SO ashamed to say it was thrifted, but c’mon, how cool is it that you have one-of-a-kind clothing that no one else will ever have?!
Besides, vintage stuff is so much more unique and cool than anything else you’d ever find at a store like <a href= "https://www.forever21.com/us/shop" > Forever 21 </a> (though I do love a good basic T)! And there's always something for everyone at thrift stores! </font> </center>

<p> <center> <font size = "3">
So to mostly share my love of thrift shopping with the rest of the world and also to justify the amount of thrifting I do :l , I’m creating Closet Ivy Lou! I know that many people find thrifting very annoying and tedious (aka. my twin sister haha) so I hope that I can bring the best stuff to you guys <em> online <em/>! </font> </center>
